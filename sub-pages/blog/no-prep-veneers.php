                            <p>No-prep veneers have many different name brands, like Lumineers, DURAthins, Vivaneers and more. And everyone is asking about them! Here’s why no-prep veneers are an increasingly popular choice for improving your smile. No-prep means we don’t have to drill your teeth or reduce your tooth surface to fit the veneers to your smile.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>No-prep veneers are similar in nature to contact lenses. Because the porcelain used is so thin we can bond to your teeth without creating bulk. If you’re a candidate for no-prep veneers, you can have the smile of your dreams without drilling and without having to be numbed!</p>

                        <br>
                        <h3>Let Us Show You!</h3>
                        <p>This is an photograph of an actual patient, halfway through the bonding process of a no-prep case. We love this picture because it quickly demonstrates how you can change the size, shape, color, and the contours of the tooth – sometimes without doing any drilling whatsoever.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h3>How Do They Look?</h3>
                        <p>Our no-prep veneers look just as good, and sometimes better, than the traditional porcelain veneers we deliver every day. When you look online at no-prep veneers you often see ugly, bulky, Chiclet-looking teeth. We’ve heard horror stories about tooth sensitivity and veneers popping off. These stories are not what our patients experience!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Atlanta Dental Spa’s dentists spend considerable time, effort, and money to become experts in delivering beautiful smiles. Patients want their smiles to look beautiful, feel great and last a long time. And that’s what we deliver. Our no-prep veneer patients love every aspect of their new smiles.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Less is More</h3>
                        <p>Even if a few of your teeth are able to receive no-prep veneers it doesn’t mean your teeth have to be aggressively drilled. Our dentists have mastered a hybrid technique using the most minimally invasive procedure for each tooth. You may have some teeth that need minor reshaping and some that are completely no-prep.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Another reason so many people choose Atlanta Dental Spa for no-prep veneers is because we fit your investment to your lifestyle. We have financing options available so you can achieve the smile you always wanted and deserve.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Contact us to schedule a consultation and take the first step toward the smile of your dreams!</p>
